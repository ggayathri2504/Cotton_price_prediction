# Cotton_price_prediction
The price of cotton in USD/pound of 5 decades are analyzed to calculate the probability of future market trend. An artificial intelligence based solution is developed. Various models are fit under trial and error method to identify a best suit model for this particular dataset.

#Methodology

The dataset is collected from a reliable website which is said to consist of two attributes with a discrete set of values - DATE and VALUES (price of cotton measured in USD per pound) . It is univariate in nature . It takes into account around 5 decades of cottonâ€™s prices for analysis . Initially the dataset is preprocessed by checking for null values . Then date is set as the index of the dataframe for better visualisation . After that a simple graph with date in the x-axis and price in the y-axis is plotted to categorize it as stationary or non-stationary . As far as stationarity is concerned two values are not dependent based on time. Instead it relies on the rule of realizations. That is correlation between two variables are not dependent on their values but on the lag between them. Then a duplicate data frame is created with date and target variable so that any changes acquired in the process aren't reflected on the original data. Later the data set is split into training and validation sets with 80% of data. Now after a basic exploration of the dataset it is evaluated using various models like moving average , KNN , autoarima , prophet and LSTM . So after comparing the model with lower RMSE(root mean square error) value and a higher accuracy rate is considered as the best fit .

#Result

At last the LSTM model was found to be the precise one .
